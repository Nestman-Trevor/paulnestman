                                <p>Paul and I had the opportunity to work together for several years in a publicly reporting company. Paul not only took care of all the operational accounting and finance functions, but also prepared and completed all our quarterly and annual filings. Our auditors commented each time how clean and ready we were for their external reviews because of Paul's stellar work in having all our accounting work and financial statements ready with all working papers. Working with Paul was great and he was a solid member of our team.</p>
