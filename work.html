                                <p>Paul and I had the opportunity to work together for several years in a publicly reporting company. Paul not only took care of all the operational accounting and finance functions, but also prepared and completed all our quarterly and annual filings. Our auditors commented each time how clean and ready we were for their external reviews because of Paul's stellar work in having all our accounting work and financial statements ready with all working papers. Working with Paul was great and he was a solid member of our team.</p>

                                <p>It’s my pleasure to provide a recommendation for Paul. I hired Paul as our Corporate Controller prior to our company acquiring two different companies. Paul played an integral part in the due diligence process, and did an excellent job of overseeing the integration of these entities into our financial reporting requirements with the SEC. During Paul’s tenure with us, all of our 10-Qs and 10-Ks were timely filed without ever needing to make any audit adjustments. I was impressed with Paul’s technical abilities as well as his abilities to manage others, and his ability to work with multiple departments when required. Paul would be a great asset to any team.</p>
